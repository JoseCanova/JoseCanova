vision for kids. 
continue with the interface - afternoon.
need to rest a little. such movies doesn't help because does not explain to much interesting things.
but they are cool.
amazing.. i thought about cancer. need a checkup can be in the brain too. and causes flutuations of humour.

### Good part is that now i have a small fever. so i can rest with justification. 
this cold winter is quite cold.

### Fixing the path with a edge-vertex validator.
Time to start the test on avoid vertex on edge (it's valid). consider the vertex like an obstacle.
At least this. It worked as "expected". Amazing. 
Need to read carefully but seems that worked very well; 
I as give a path from Artist to Recording.
It presented 2 solutions.

It's quite interesting. The maze presents 2 solutions.
1 with 5 nodes (weight 5) and other with 6 nodes (weight 6).
Need to import the DB (this is not a big problem), and define a criteria of evaluation of the paths. that is if both generate the same solution, and if not at which part of the "invalid path" that does not generate a valid solution shall be marked as on such context is invalid. 
But its promising something interesting. 

### About nomenclature
The model with generic common atribute, is what flaws a scan without checking the "foreign relations", its good and bad. will try to use the "foreign keys" to fix the model graph.
2 steps. first add the vertex. then using the fk's add the edges.
A simple unit test a  problem faster than debug for sure.
Simple is .. use scan. and in a "aftre edition" can edit. and update the edges (add/remove)
How to mark bad vertex. because db dont know inheritance. and the path is going to a "generic table". now i know that is not a good practice. but is ORM. 

#### Need to remodel that "base type" too generic.
and "for some reason" is good but it's bad. first will look the pathvalidator let's see if it fix.

#### Fixed the MetaEdge... suggest good code. who uses jgrapht 
knows the edge intrusive and need to ne intrusive to work with the source/target///
since classes are the most immutable thing on java. 
in this schenario you can invade the privacy of the default attributes.

### Shannon Rat. 

YenKShortestPath - with a pathvalidator... (that is just beggining invalid in a context).
Lets keep it simple.. you cannot say that you will collide after you crashed. 
So.. need avoid a specific vertex.

### 1 litle thing.
My friends on front putting some fun musics... why they are my friends.. ? 
We know each other for like 10 years.. (almost)... we didn't exchange a letter. but what is good on this.if someone understand.
This is important. we never exchange words that could offend each other.
### Dont make me laugh
Was that astronaut that google shown to me that "game me legs that i dont have"... 
https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-62140044
they know me better than i... 
and if you ask me... yes... "if i have i gun i commit a mistake..."

3 days crying.

Ethics we learned \at IBM... 

your google account... what this person's are talking about... ?

### You google account ... wtf... what you are saying... 

its not about money... it's science... admiration.. friendshiot.. jezz holy christy...

### if you see something talk with your doesn't matter the consequences... 

It's your obligation


### Fix the Query
I know what im talking about... Oracle handle with cursors pages different from SqlServer... which means... even in memory.
Tom (the vp) will say or said... keep as we always deal with it...

### you virtual bare metal... ]
if Page dreams about it... !why you left die by starvation? 
And he is a good friend..
That's is his answer... 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj_rvLVpqg8&list=RDJDG2m5hN1vo&index=15

look at that... 
### Important is the answer is correct. 
The engine don't that "this table" is a "special kind of table... need to check how to fix such "genericity",
seems like a "inspection phase"...  which kind of table is you.?

### I will work in the idea.. 
I looked again.. this is beautifull. need to focus on this for now.  
After several years. you understand the things on practical model. pick this days. and work in the idea. the depression almost got me. another thing that i remember what is very well. but this is biochemical reactions caused by events that im not on the command.
I will try to finish and, again to present to someone that could evaluate and check if it's practical since some technicall concerns are beyond my capacity (im not a hero).
Lets do it.
Simple to understand, when i finish the crawl, the translated metamodel need to be persisted. mainly because  the part that need to augment the metamodel with information that is not collected on the fly. Cache for example. (for ex. this table can be cached). With in memory this is not necessary. But not all databases neither all budgets can spent all of data on memory. if no body is looking for a data it can go to cache (memory) when is acessed.

#### the old man... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMbATaj7Il8&list=RDJDG2m5hN1vo&index=3
he did exactly what he said to me... if im strong enough... i will broke that hospital...
### Where i stopped?. 
Well i generate a metamodel based on a "metamodel definition" , that i need to improve, then after test again the model that i have.

### Let me think. 
On the application, opensource, im not a hero, so, work for tommorrow.
1 - The application of the thing, well, it's almost like the "Postman Flow (i remember a meeting)". with the difference that is on "practical mode" not testing mode. The restapi if well thinked can turned into production ready (for queries is quite simple , for updates operation need to know the database very well but can be used too) since is working with projections.

  Which means that for queries is just create the correct path, in a "better worlds model". The taxonomy need to analyzed to not collide namespaces, model mapper shows that its a common practice. But as soon it cames up is production ready for queries, this is amazing. 
  why?
  because a cache can be defined in specific parts of the "query path". see?
  For examplex.. you a have a query that is defined by 4 tables. without second level cache. just table by table. you define a cache you can pre-configure the cache.
  need to check how to do this.

People are fun. 
I understood, it will work, but its now a work to do alone. There are a lot of small things, that need to be described somewhere. No crystal balls, probably a story shall exist because there are some details to describe on the services. some are simples other dont and we need some description to compare the actual with the "service that will replace".  Not that big issue, but jsut this can take 2 days to understand. 

#### A game but serious game hum?

You know... if we decide to "reconstruct Sun" that for me... is a mark/. We are Sun.. .again... and the time seems that come..

### In the words of Google

Fuck off.. they are my friends.. before you dream... nobody talk by proxy by their name.

nothing is wrong.. 

#### hardest than google is sun.. 

it's more much more.. than a brand... it's  word a compromise with ACM... 

Nice - I will try to mount a presentation of the "thesis proposal"... 
It's almost a thesis. 
## FOR NOW WORK
I writing the "unit tests" for what i proposed to deliver tomorrrow. 
This is how what i can on the scheduled. 
## QUITE SIMPLE - I need to simulate an API. 
This is what im writing. problem is that the OpenApi does not processing well the version 2.01 on postman , swagger nothing
I had to write ll by hand finished now.. and starting unittests then after will pick i guess modelmapper. 
indeed i have to tak a look.
found a stackoverflow on lombok... 
the code that generated the classes is buggy (my few hours code) and 
on somemoment the copy-paste with repeated attributes throwns a StackOverflow.
interesting.

## checking this
https://thepracticaldeveloper.com/guide-spring-boot-controller-tests/

###Feign need a "port responding".. 
But is working the unit tests. so. in theory the mockserver on customer environment is just to avoid 
round trips. 
now continue the tests.

I am doing what i have planned to show tomorrow. but this weekend i didn't worked well as planned. 
And i know , it will not have "the show part" i know. but, as i said that i will try to reach a point that i estimated. 
Trying to reach it. 

Working fine. the change on format causes some problems. by the lucky i preserved the format.

I need to read this code - http://modelmapper.org/getting-started/

i write to not get mad.. i forgot that i could write here. its a blog too. more appropriate indeed. 

well... i forgot. as i forgot a lot of things.

let me see i mount the pojos . now i fixing the return methods of the api. (mock and controller). 

all by hand because nothing is working.

ModelMapper seems to be "verbose" but more appropriate. 

just the case to "put in the right package" the mapping classes.

i thought on other methods. but its mode appropriate. and will the "no mutability" principle.

which means configure all this "helper classes as beans".

the model doesn't fit.. hum... good hum?

what does it means? dont need modelmapper. its uselless you model one into another.  no need. to difficult. so.. use the new model. DTO.

Now Feign is complainning. I started 1-2 times.. then now is asking for properties. 

Understood. Feign can just be injected in a controller. and and Action is not controller. but this is not a problem indeed was just to check. 
So. i have to forward. foward to the controller. and send it back to the action as i configured.
But now need to think that he need to understand what means a method in the new domain name. 

Its not complicate to understand the concept. 
When is a struts-form, dispatch to struts . then struts forward to the controller. the controller check the method. executes the restquery and returns. 
when is jquery is on the controller direct. 
need to adjust the domain and adjust jqueryurl's.
