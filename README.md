### And as usual i fucked up all... i have promised to me... don't fuck up... and i fucked... 
At least "writing"... justify some future actions.. 

first wasn't me who fucked up... that "old behavior".. .asking things.. that are old... same behavior... 
I answering there is model... simple ... someone on XP... could help a lot.. 
This is how we sold things on half time.

Knowing me... it a sure... 

Well you read that and posted... and wrote that and wrote again about somehting.. 

this is i will 50/50 ... if you dont wanna read it its your problem.. not mine.. 

the other side came with same problem.. who want to show what i want to see?

me... but ... i guess im impersonating.. 

It's not a problems it's a knowledge gained..

We are programmers... we know that it's bytebuddy + schemacrawler + my hands... 

but how i said... "I never saw that"... then i read a concern ... 

that versions of database models are coming back... i realized why..

at this level... you can say what you are ... whatever you say... you need to be understood.. 

which means your symbols need to be verified against a taxonomy symbom identification.. 

that aggregates information in your body... 

After reducing the mutability then think about increase speed... grpc... is a migration after all... 

mutability is chain the things.. avoid the "document encapsulation this is important"... 

transformation is "role of the programmer"... which means... the last backend man... 

In matter of fact my 2 friends were betting ... hum... "10 days... 20days until he going to stress?"

but i never saw that. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGwWNGJdvx8&list=RD7F8MJE91Py8&index=27

"_OLD"... that thing fucked me big... :-) imagine.. they know ... 
they are giant ... king... educated... people... 

i am programmed to think combinations.

chainning things reduce the mutability... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhisVOQb6gU&list=RD7F8MJE91Py8&index=27

fuck his last speech.. we are closed... (except me he had be... this is the week.. ;-) ) 

it's the same ... then i presumed the Y carrer... the problem of translation and words and code... and show ... 

that what i said... we are running aat... 2mg.. with n ... agents... need 4mgb for more n agents...

this is done just with a certain level of immutability.. 

this means that i can use low-level access doens't matter... but i need to isolate... and check and report how much is mutable the thing... 

and "isolate"!... its a service that produce the result... 

taxonomy are the losses and the gains is where you represent... the thing after all .. someone need to understand... 

you are saying that if i sign this "you are with me..." that's is my actual bussiness where i was working... "fuck fuck fuck"

that thing that end ... was the best... undestand that ... the small pieces of code under "very determined conext are ideas..."

that say we are important.. we shall point ... that the best model reproves... such actions ... and we cannot adopt your model under our model.. 

unless you agree to certain changes... because we cannot hurt the image of the technoly that we proposing to adopt.

and analysing your model detected "impedance mismatches"... 

I dont need to ask.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pGGst9Ir8U&list=RD7F8MJE91Py8&index=27

they are my friends... watching at distance...

i dont need to ask what to answer... 

Am I auditing now, im auditing... audited pointed... that enough.. 

It the tarot cards... Y carrer... he is friend... i pointed where he will have problem.. 

and if this problem appear.. you are mine... 

you dont need to change that shit ... im assure you... that oracle haven't change the way of the things are on that point. because this oracle way.. 

Larry Ellison said.. you should that we moving the thing to memory.. which means ... that ... finnaly we can go back to our models.. 

And with that ... things that are oracle is oracle... that thing is good ... on that context ... can cause problems... 

that page stuff.. that is "different from sql server ..." need to check.. 

just because that see how complicated... the things are... not because nothing... that thing of 'pages'... 

1 boss ... 1 chief... chief can have whatever he/she as "technical assistants."

Defending the boss and my friend.. immutability is our time but not our fault.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNyIhirtXUI&list=RDGMEM_v2KDBP3d4f8uT-ilrs8fQ&start_radio=1&rv=7nPy1Bpmisw

see... we should handle with all mutation... ah fuck offf... 

oracle native + jdbc... = problems.. 

doesnt means that something is bad... means that you isolate and check ... 'how much mutable is that'... 

if you check on "best case scenarios" you will see a surprise ... that your idea . is quite immutable is continues in a service like rest stuff... 

the guy on next knows whaat to handle mutbility... if he is "merging data"... he need to check.. mutability... 

And the stakeholder knows what could happen and its justified if i present a idea...

Ow.. that's it ? its not a bad idea if we isolate .. the mutaations on something that deal just with it.. 

It's not personall ... it's mutation... we can cause it... but 'it's ... mutation'... reducing... weird things solves.. 

I'm doing the transformations and i saw.. ops the gave the rules... which.. means.. the ruels is yours now... and i screw all friday... 

isn't perfect? the timming was perfect :-) 

What if ? if that meeting didn't exist... and some other assumptions could be removed... aw... welll ... the d-d... was almost finished.

That thing "show to chief what you did... " it's not time chief... 

small , 30 yrs younger... but it's my chief... she owns that rule.... 

she need to ask whatever she wants... but she.

Inquiring.. to acquire feeling... 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVUK2rtAkJE&list=RDGMEM_v2KDBP3d4f8uT-ilrs8fQ&index=3

need to be convinced... at end... 

and she saw the terror at friday.. that's it... the boss if the boss your are the chief..

i pointed the problem , the error and when will happen (this is an estimation)... this what im built for... 

 was fast... "Hibernate generate..."
 
 And the day after was most curious.. someone said ... "that i replied.." ... "are you crazy.. when i found... this is me"...
