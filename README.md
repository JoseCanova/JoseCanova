Nice - I will try to mount a presentation of the "thesis proposal"... 
It's almost a thesis. 
## FOR NOW WORK
I writing the "unit tests" for what i proposed to deliver tomorrrow. 
This is how what i can on the scheduled. 
## QUITE SIMPLE - I need to simulate an API. 
This is what im writing. problem is that the OpenApi does not processing well the version 2.01 on postman , swagger nothing
I had to write ll by hand finished now.. and starting unittests then after will pick i guess modelmapper. 
indeed i have to tak a look.
found a stackoverflow on lombok... 
the code that generated the classes is buggy (my few hours code) and 
on somemoment the copy-paste with repeated attributes throwns a StackOverflow.
interesting.

###Feign need a "port responding".. 
But is working the unit tests. so. in theory the mockserver on customer environment is just to avoid 
round trips. 
now continue the tests.

I am doing what i have planned to show tomorrow. but this weekend i didn't worked well as planned. 

Working fine. the change on format causes some problems. by the lucky i preserved the format.

I need to read this code - http://modelmapper.org/getting-started/

i write to not get mad.. i forgot that i could write here. its a blog too. more appropriate indeed. 

well... i forgot. as i forgot a lot of things.

let me see i mount the pojos . now i fixing the return methods of the api. (mock and controller). 

all by hand because nothing is working.
