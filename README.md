### And as usual i fucked up all... i have promised to me... don't fuck up... and i fucked... 
At least "writing"... justify some future actions.. 

first wasn't me who fucked up... that "old behavior".. .asking things.. that are old... same behavior... 
I answering there is model... simple ... someone on XP... could help a lot.. 
This is how we sold things on half time.

Knowing me... it a sure... 

Well you read that and posted... and wrote that and wrote again about somehting.. 

this is i will 50/50 ... if you dont wanna read it its your problem.. not mine.. 

the other side came with same problem.. who want to show what i want to see?

me... but ... i guess im impersonating.. 

It's not a problems it's a knowledge gained..

We are programmers... we know that it's bytebuddy + schemacrawler + my hands... 

but how i said... "I never saw that"... then i read a concern ... 

that versions of database models are coming back... i realized why..

at this level... you can say what you are ... whatever you say... you need to be understood.. 

which means your symbols need to be verified against a taxonomy symbom identification.. 

that aggregates information in your body... 

After reducing the mutability then think about increase speed... grpc... is a migration after all... 

mutability is chain the things.. avoid the "document encapsulation this is important"... 

transformation is "role of the programmer"... which means... the last backend man... 

In matter of fact my 2 friends were betting ... hum... "10 days... 20days until he going to stress?"

but i never saw that. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGwWNGJdvx8&list=RD7F8MJE91Py8&index=27

"_OLD"... that thing fucked me big... :-) imagine.. they know ... 
they are giant ... king... educated... people... 

i am programmed to think combinations.

chainning things reduce the mutability... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhisVOQb6gU&list=RD7F8MJE91Py8&index=27

fuck his last speech.. we are closed... (except me he had be... this is the week.. ;-) ) 

it's the same ... then i presumed the Y carrer... the problem of translation and words and code... and show ... 

that what i said... we are running aat... 2mg.. with n ... agents... need 4mgb for more n agents...

this is done just with a certain level of immutability.. 

this means that i can use low-level access doens't matter... but i need to isolate... and check and report how much is mutable the thing... 

and "isolate"!... its a service that produce the result... 

taxonomy are the losses and the gains is where you represent... the thing after all .. someone need to understand... 

you are saying that if i sign this "you are with me..." that's is my actual bussiness where i was working... "fuck fuck fuck"

that thing that end ... was the best... undestand that ... the small pieces of code under "very determined conext are ideas..."

that say we are important.. we shall point ... that the best model reproves... such actions ... and we cannot adopt your model under our model.. 

unless you agree to certain changes... because we cannot hurt the image of the technoly that we proposing to adopt.
